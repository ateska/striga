To enable syntax highlighting in Eclipse, you need to use 
Color Editor plugin ( http://www.gstaff.org/colorEditor/ ).

More over you need to associate *.stpy to be opened by this editor.

Also you have to modify color editor plugin jar file (cbg.editor_1.2.6.jar).
Open it in any Zip browser, go to modes directory and copy there files 'catalog'
and 'striga.xml' from this directory. Then restart Eclipse and you are done.
