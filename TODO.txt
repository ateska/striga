* FIXME - Rollover in logging file handler is not thread-safe (causing hangs and/or empty log files)

* FIXME - SIGTERM (and maybe other signals) should cause nice shutdown 

* site.conf in striga has different format than site.conf in ramona (maybe striga can detect 'new' format by searching for [general] on first line of site.conf)

* Finalize and test tools/projecttemplate

* **kwargs option for static tags (or any other way how to supply optional parameters for tags)

* CONDITIONAL attributes -> <option(selected="selected" if item.selected == True)

* namespace for attributes - something like <A HREF="..." NS('exiNS', ATTR1='this is namespace attribute', ATTR2='this is another one')

* Workers/subprocesses must implement keep-alive notification (and non-responding workers should be killed)
	- implement heartbeating (regular periodic message) + long-operation notification (explicit notification of long operation that can prevent heartbeat) from worker/subprocess

* tagimport exihtml.form (<exihtml.form.form) should work !!! - problem is in tagimport of submodules

* Implement sections to tags (allowing us to implement complex tags like <HTML> with inheritent <HEAD> and <BODY> sections)

* Review striga extrenals - enum and spark

* HTTP context extension with 'common fields' - filled from CGI Environments for example (this should help to resolve issues like request URL resolution)

* implement better reloading support - we have problems with tagimport now (cascasing imports are not working due to conflict in sys.modules)
! Own version of import !

* ExHTML component 'auto-refresh'
- button that trigger automated refreshing of current page
- there can be USER option to on/off/change interval of refresh
- there cen be also DEVELOPER option 'delayed refresh' (every next automated refresh will happen with increased period - potentionaly leading to logout by timeout)
- Page must contain 'extended' environment with 'URL for refresh'

* class and id parameter of active tag (check exihtml implementation and enhance)

* form action attribute (it is problematic to specify target of form)

* Automated forms !!!

* improve/rework striga compiler (stand-alone FAST program)

* HTTP frontend (build-in www server)

* Redesign service model
	- service factory as function registered to global service factory registry
	- service classes (service, serviceWithStates) - some services are not 'stopable', some yes
	- service must be configured when constructed (not later)

* Test if active (only active) tags should not be instantitied on begin() - for passing params to end()
